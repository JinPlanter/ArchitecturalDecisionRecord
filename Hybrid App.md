# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## Hybrid App

### Context:

- We are in the process of developing a mobile application for a retail company, aimed at providing a seamless shopping experience to customers. This application is envisioned to include features such as product browsing, order history, loyalty programs, and more. One of the key architectural decisions is choosing whether the mobile application should be native, web, or hybrid.

<br/>

### Decision:

- We have opted to develop a hybrid mobile app instead of a native or web-based one.

<br/>

### Rationale:

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: A hybrid app, by design, allows us to create a single codebase that is deployable on multiple platforms, such as iOS and Android. This approach simplifies development, enhances code reusability, and ensures a consistent user experience across diverse devices.

- Cost-Efficiency: Building a hybrid app generally requires less development effort and cost in comparison to native apps. This is particularly advantageous for projects with budget constraints, where it's vital to achieve cross-platform compatibility while maintaining financial feasibility.

- Web Technologies: Hybrid apps leverage web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is advantageous if you have web development expertise within the team, as it reduces the learning curve and enhances development speed.

- Rapid Iteration: Hybrid apps benefit from faster development cycles and updates due to their shared codebase. This enables quicker feature releases, bug fixes, and the capacity to respond promptly to evolving market demands.

- Access to Native Features: Modern hybrid app frameworks, such as React Native and Flutter, offer access to native device features. This bridges the gap between the advantages of native and hybrid development.

<br/>

 ### Consequences:

- Performance: While hybrid apps have come a long way in optimizing performance, there might still be a gap when compared to fully native applications. This could affect user experience, especially in scenarios requiring resource-intensive operations.

- Platform-Specific Features: Implementing platform-specific features can necessitate additional development work and may not fully match the capabilities of fully native apps.

- Dependency on the Hybrid Framework: The project's success relies on the stability and continued support of the chosen hybrid framework. Any changes or updates in the framework that do not align with project requirements could present a challenge.

- App Size: The app's binary size may be larger compared to fully native apps due to the inclusion of the hybrid framework.

In view of the need for cross-platform compatibility, cost-efficiency, rapid development, and the capacity to leverage web technologies, a hybrid mobile app emerges as a suitable choice for our retail application.
