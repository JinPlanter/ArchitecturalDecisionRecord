# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## Backend Language

### Context

- We are tasked with developing a mobile app for a retail company that aims to provide a seamless shopping experience to its customers. The app will have features like product browsing, order history, loyalty programs, and more. One critical decision is choosing the appropriate backend programming language for the app's server-side development.

<br/>

### Decision

- We have decided to use Node.js as the backend programming language for the retail app.

<br/>

### Rationale

- JavaScript Expertise: Node.js is based on JavaScript, a language familiar to many developers. This familiarity can expedite development and troubleshooting, as the same language is used on both the client and server sides.

- Non-blocking I/O: Node.js is known for its non-blocking I/O model, which is well-suited for handling a large number of concurrent connections and real-time features such as push notifications and live updates.

- Vibrant Ecosystem: Node.js has a vibrant ecosystem with a vast collection of open-source libraries and packages available through npm (Node Package Manager). This allows us to leverage existing solutions for common tasks and integrate third-party services effectively.

- Scalability: Node.js's scalability and performance have been proven in various high-traffic applications, making it suitable for accommodating potential future growth of the retail app.

- Real-time Features: Node.js is well-suited for handling real-time features like push notifications, which are essential for notifying customers about order updates and special offers.

<br/>

### Consequences

- Single-Threaded: Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop, which means long-running tasks can block the event loop and affect responsiveness. Careful coding and possibly the use of worker threads may be necessary to mitigate this.

- Maturity: While Node.js is mature and widely used, it may not be the best choice for every type of application. Considerations such as CPU-bound tasks may lead to alternative language choices for specific backend services.

- Dependency Management: Managing dependencies via npm is convenient but may introduce versioning conflicts if not carefully managed.

- JavaScript-only: Using Node.js means that all backend code will be in JavaScript, which may not be ideal for developers who prefer other languages.

Considering the need for real-time features, a vibrant ecosystem, and the potential for scalability, Node.js is a suitable choice for the backend language for this retail app. It aligns well with the project's goals and requirements.
