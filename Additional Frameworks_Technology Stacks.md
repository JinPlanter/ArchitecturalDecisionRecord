# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## Additional Frameworks/Technology Stacks

### Context

- We are tasked with developing a mobile app for a retail company that aims to provide a seamless shopping experience to its customers. The app will have features like product browsing, order history, loyalty programs, and more. One critical decision is choosing any additional frameworks or technology stacks to enhance the app's functionality and performance.

<br/>

### Decision

- We have decided to incorporate the following additional frameworks and technology stacks into the app's development:

    1. React Navigation for handling navigation and routing within the app.

    2. Firebase as a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for real-time updates, push notifications, and analytics.

    3. Redux for state management, ensuring a predictable and efficient way to manage the app's data.

<br/>

### Rationale

- React Navigation:
  - Navigation Efficiency: React Navigation provides a reliable and efficient way to handle navigation between different screens and routes in the app.
  - Consistent User Experience: It ensures a consistent and smooth user experience, crucial for a retail app.

- Firebase:
  - Real-time Updates: Firebase offers real-time database capabilities, which are essential for keeping product availability, order status, and loyalty program points up to date.
  - Push Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) can be integrated for sending push notifications, enhancing user engagement.
  - Analytics: Firebase Analytics provides valuable insights into user behavior, helping us make data-driven improvements.

- Redux:
  - State Management: Redux provides a centralized store for managing the app's state, making it easier to maintain and scale as the app grows.
  - Predictable State Changes: Redux enforces a predictable pattern for state changes, which simplifies debugging and enhances maintainability.

<br/>

### Consequences

- Learning Curve: Team members may need time to familiarize themselves with these additional frameworks and technology stacks if they are not already experienced with them.

- Integration Effort: Integrating these additional technologies requires additional development effort, but the benefits in terms of navigation, real-time capabilities, and state management outweigh this cost.

- Dependency on Third-Party Services: We will be dependent on Firebase services and their availability. Ongoing monitoring and maintenance will be necessary to ensure service reliability.

- Code Complexity: Implementing Redux for state management may introduce additional complexity to the app's codebase, but it enhances maintainability.

Given the need for efficient navigation, real-time updates, push notifications, analytics, and robust state management, incorporating React Navigation, Firebase, and Redux into the app's development is the appropriate decision. These technologies will contribute to a feature-rich and performant retail app.
