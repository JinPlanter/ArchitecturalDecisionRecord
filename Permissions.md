# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## Permissions

### Context

- We are tasked with developing a mobile app for a retail company that aims to provide a seamless shopping experience to its customers. The app will have features like product browsing, order history, loyalty programs, and more. One critical decision is how to manage and implement permissions within the app.
Decision

- We have decided to implement fine-grained permissions control within the app, using a combination of built-in mobile platform permissions and custom permission checks.

<br/>

### Rationale

- User Privacy: Fine-grained permissions allow users to have more control over what data and functionality they share with the app, which aligns with user privacy expectations.

- Security: Custom permission checks provide an additional layer of security, allowing us to control access to sensitive features and data, such as payment information and loyalty program details.

- User Experience: By requesting permissions only when necessary and explaining why they are needed, we can enhance the user experience by reducing unnecessary interruptions and requests.

- Compliance: Fine-grained permissions help the app comply with data protection regulations and user consent requirements, such as GDPR and CCPA.

- Granular Control: Custom permission checks allow us to implement granular control over features like push notifications, location access, and accessing user data, ensuring that permissions are used appropriately.

### Consequences

- Complexity: Implementing fine-grained permissions can introduce complexity into the app's codebase, requiring careful design and testing to ensure proper functionality and security.

- User Education: Users may need to be educated about the importance of permissions and how they enhance their experience and security within the app.

- Development Effort: Developing custom permission checks may require additional development effort compared to relying solely on built-in platform permissions.

- Maintenance: Regular updates and maintenance will be necessary to keep the app compliant with changing privacy regulations and evolving user expectations.

Given the need to balance user privacy, security, and compliance with data protection regulations, implementing fine-grained permissions control is the appropriate decision for this retail app. It allows us to provide users with transparency and control while ensuring the security of sensitive features and data.
