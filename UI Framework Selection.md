# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
## UI Framework Selection

### Context:

- We are embarking on the development of a mobile application for a retail company that aims to deliver a seamless shopping experience to its customers. The application will encompass features such as product browsing, order history, loyalty programs, and more.

<br/>

### Decision:

- We have chosen to employ React Native as the cross-platform UI framework for developing the mobile application.

<br/>

### Rationale:

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: React Native is a reputable cross-platform framework that facilitates the creation of a single codebase, allowing the application to run on both iOS and Android platforms. This approach minimizes development effort, enhances code maintainability, and guarantees a uniform user experience across devices.

- JavaScript Expertise: Utilizing React Native is particularly advantageous when the development team already possesses a strong background in JavaScript. This familiarity can expedite the development process, leading to time and cost savings.

- Access to Native Modules: React Native provides access to a broad array of native modules and components. This facilitates the integration of platform-specific features, such as camera functionality or location services, ensuring that the application can harness the full capabilities of the device.

- Performance: React Native is designed to optimize application performance, offering a user experience comparable to native apps. It accomplishes this through components that bridge between JavaScript and native code, resulting in fast and responsive applications.

- Active Community and Ecosystem: React Native boasts a thriving community of developers, which translates to a rich ecosystem of libraries, plugins, and third-party tools. This expansive community support accelerates development, simplifies problem-solving, and offers a plethora of resources for the project.

<br/>

### Consequences:

- Learning Curve: Team members already familiar with JavaScript may transition smoothly to React Native. However, some adaptation may be necessary for those new to React Native, which could temporarily impact development velocity.

- Dependency on React Native: The project's success will be contingent on React Native's stability and ongoing support. Any changes or updates in React Native that diverge from our project requirements could present a challenge.

- Platform-Specific Features: Although React Native allows for the integration of platform-specific features, some advanced or intricate features may require additional development effort.

- App Size: The app's binary size may be larger compared to fully native apps, primarily due to the inclusion of the React Native runtime and bridge.

In light of the need for cross-platform compatibility, JavaScript proficiency, access to native modules, and a performant user experience, React Native emerges as a pragmatic choice for our retail application's UI framework.
